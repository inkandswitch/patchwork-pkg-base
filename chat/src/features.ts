// Features are NOT a hardcoded struct on the component. Each big feature is a
// `chat:feature` plugin declaration (host-registrable, like the other four types);
// a tool enables features by passing ONE selector that applies across every plugin
// type. The component gates its UI on `hasFeature(id)` — it never holds a fixed
// list of known features.
//
// A tool's selector is `"all" | "core" | string[]`:
//   "all"     → every plugin of every type (built-in + host-contributed)
//   "core"    → only tier:"core" plugins (the minimal `chat` tool)
//   string[]  → an explicit set of plugin ids, spanning feature/parser/slash/…
//               types (a plugin id is matched regardless of its type)

// contact avatars + names, inline `code`/`*bold*`/`_italic_`/fences, image send and
// patchwork-tool embedding are ALWAYS on (not gated) — they're the chat itself.
// Replies ride the (core-tier) `reply` message-action, so no flag here.
