 * Undo/redo history, owned by the base editor. Tools must not add their own
 * `history()`: the underlying history state field is a module-level singleton
 * in `@codemirror/commands`, so a second copy elsewhere in the configuration
 * would keep the field alive across our reset and defeat it.
 *
 * The stack is reset whenever the handle's backing is swapped in place (a
 * `change` event with `scopeReplaced: true` — e.g. scrubbing history or
 * switching drafts re-points the handle at a different clone): the old
 * entries describe a different timeline, and undo must only revert what the
 * user has done since. CodeMirror has no clear-history API; the sanctioned
 * reset is cycling the extension out of and back into the configuration,
 * which drops the history field's state and re-creates it empty.
