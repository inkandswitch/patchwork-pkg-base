/**
 * The worker provider — the SERVING half of `patchwork:worker-channel`.
 *
 * Mounted in the host realm as a `patchwork:component`, it answers worker-channel
 * subscriptions by running the requested worker HERE and transferring its
 * `{readable, writable}` stream pair back to the consumer. Under isolation the
 * consumer is inside the sandbox and only the streams cross; the worker, and any
 * config or secrets it resolves, never leave the host.
 *
 * It is KIND-AGNOSTIC. Workers are resolved from the `patchwork:worker` plugin
 * registry by the selector's `kind`, so this file imports nothing
 * service-specific — no LLM, no config, no secrets. A package that owns a worker
 * registers it declaratively:
 *
 *   // in a Patchwork package's `plugins` array
 *   {type: "patchwork:worker", id: "llm", name: "LLM",
 *    async load() { return llmWorkerSpec }}
 *
 * and `load()` resolves to a `WorkerSpec` (see @grjte/patchwork-worker/serve.js):
 * `{createWorker, open?, handle, abort?}`. The provider hands the spec to
 * `serveWorkerSpec`, which owns the streams, the worker lifetime, and the id
 * demux; the spec owns only the service's op vocabulary.
 *
 * Package placement: this lives in the host-only `providers` package and imports
 * the transport's serve half from `@grjte/patchwork-worker/serve.js`. The
 * consumer half (`connect.js`, the only file a sandboxed tool loads) never
 * imports this module, so the plugin registry stays out of the sandbox.
 *
 * Three invariants make this reliable rather than racy:
 *
 *   1. DECLINE SYNCHRONOUSLY, CLAIM SYNCHRONOUSLY. `registry.has(kind)` is sync,
 *      so a kind we cannot serve is left to bubble (another provider may answer)
 *      by returning BEFORE `accept()`. `accept()` itself claims with
 *      `stopPropagation()` before running the producer, so a kind we can serve is
 *      claimed before any await — otherwise the event finishes bubbling while we
 *      wait and an ancestor double-answers.
 *   2. ALWAYS SETTLE A CLAIMED REQUEST. Once claimed, the consumer is waiting on
 *      this subscription, so every path must reply — the stream pair on success,
 *      an explicit `null` on failure. Staying silent turns a bad config or a
 *      throwing worker into a hang.
 *   3. LISTEN AT THE DOCUMENT, NOT THE MOUNT ELEMENT. `patchwork:subscribe`
 *      bubbles and is `composed`, so a document-level listener catches every
 *      request regardless of where this provider sits relative to the consumer.
 *      Listening on the mount element instead would make correctness depend on
 *      this component having mounted before any consumer dispatches — and
 *      `patchwork-view` mounting is async twice over (a deferred render, then an
 *      async registry load), so a host would have to gate its whole subtree on
 *      this provider being ready. That gate is a bad trade: `patchwork-view`
 *      emits no event when a component fails to load, so a failed load would
 *      leave the gated subtree blank forever. Listening at the document keeps
 *      this an optional capability that degrades to "no worker available"
 *      instead of taking the frame down with it. (The sibling providers in this
 *      package listen on their mount element; this one deliberately differs.)
