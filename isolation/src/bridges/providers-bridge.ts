/**
 * Providers bridge — relays provider subscriptions from the iframe to
 * host-side providers across the isolation boundary.
 *
 * The iframe forwards ALL unclaimed `patchwork:subscribe` events to the
 * host via RPC. The host checks the subscription type against an allowlist
 * and either answers it (by dispatching a real `patchwork:subscribe` on
 * the host element) or rejects it.
 *
 * This bridge exists because DOM events don't cross iframe boundaries.
 * Provider subscriptions use `patchwork:subscribe` CustomEvents that bubble
 * up the DOM tree — inside the iframe, they can only reach local providers.
 * Subscriptions that no local provider answers (e.g. `patchwork:contact`)
 * are forwarded here so host-side providers (e.g. AccountProvider) can
 * respond.
 *
 * Security: the allowlist is managed on the host side. The iframe cannot
 * influence which subscription types are bridged.
 *
 * Protocol:
 *   iframe → host:  { type: "providers-bridge", id, selector }
 *   host → iframe:  { type: "providers-bridge-change", id, value }
 *   host → iframe:  { type: "providers-bridge-rejected", id }
 *   iframe → host:  { type: "providers-bridge-unsubscribe", id }
