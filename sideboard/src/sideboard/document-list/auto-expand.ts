/**
 * Walk the folder tree from `folderUrl` and collect the URLs of every folder
 * that has a selected document somewhere in its subtree — i.e. the set of
 * folders that must be expanded for the selection to be visible.
 *
 * This reads folder docs directly (one cached `repo.find` each) rather than
 * relying on mounted components, so it finds the full ancestor chain even for a
 * deeply nested selection whose folders aren't mounted yet. Leaf docs are never
 * loaded — selection is matched against the urls already present in each
 * folder's docrefs.
 *
 * Returns whether `folderUrl`'s subtree contains a selection; ancestors are
 * accumulated into `result`. `visited` is branched per path so a folder that
 * legitimately appears under two parents is handled, while true cycles stop.
